# Homeopathic Doctor Types

Vitalis classifies every doctor account with a **homeopathic doctor type** and optional **specialty focus**. This drives labels in the doctor app, admin onboarding, and HR joining letters.

---

## Doctor types

| Code | Label | Typical use |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `CHIEF_CONSULTANT` | Homeopathic Doctor (Chief Consultant) | Senior lead consultant, full clinic access |
| `JUNIOR_DOCTOR` | Junior Homeopathic Doctor | Full-time associate doctors |
| `SPECIALIST_CONSULTANT` | Specialist Homeopathic Consultant | Domain experts (requires focus below) |
| `VISITING_DOCTOR` | Visiting Doctor | Part-time / locum; limited slots & earnings UI |
| `TELEMEDICINE_DOCTOR` | Telemedicine Doctor | Remote consultations |
| `MEDICAL_INTERN` | Medical Intern | Supervised practice; no prescriptions in app nav |
| `RESIDENT_MEDICAL_OFFICER` | Resident Medical Officer (RMO) | Hospital-style resident role |

---

## Specialist focus (required for `SPECIALIST_CONSULTANT`)

| Code | Label |
|------|-------|
| `SKIN` | Skin |
| `CHILD` | Child |
| `WOMENS_HEALTH` | Women's Health |
| `CHRONIC_DISEASES` | Chronic Diseases |

When focus is set, displayed specialty defaults to e.g. **Skin Specialist** unless admin overrides the free-text specialty field.

---

## Where it is stored

Prisma model `Doctor` (`apps/api/prisma/schema/hr.prisma`):

- `doctorType` — `HomeopathicDoctorType` (default `JUNIOR_DOCTOR`)
- `specialtyFocus` — `HomeopathicSpecialtyFocus?` (only for specialists)
- `specialty` — display string (e.g. `Homeopathy`, `Skin Specialist`)
- `designation` — HR designation (optional)

Migration: `20260703170000_homeopathic_doctor_types`

## App behavior by type

Capabilities are defined in `apps/api/src/constants/homeopathic-doctor-types.ts` and mirrored in `doctor-web` (`doctor-types.constants.ts`).

| Type | Worklist / patients | Case analysis | Prescriptions | Slots | Earnings |
|------|---------------------|---------------|---------------|-------|----------|
| Chief Consultant | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Junior Doctor | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Specialist | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Visiting | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | — | — |
| Telemedicine | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Medical Intern | ✓ | ✓ | — | — | — |
| RMO | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

**Note:** Nav hiding is a UX guard. API prescription rules can be tightened per type in a later phase.

## Admin workflow

1. Open **Admin → Doctors → Create Doctor**
2. Choose **Doctor type**
3. If **Specialist**, choose **Specialty focus**
4. Optionally override **Specialty** text
5. Save — doctor sees type badge in **Doctor Console** header after login

Self-enrollment (`POST /doctor/enroll`) defaults new applicants to **Junior Homeopathic Doctor** until admin changes the type.

---

## Doctor app UX

- **Header** — name, type badge, specialty (`doctor-shell`)
- **Profile** — read-only type/focus; doctor edits availability and contact details
- **Navigation** — tabs filtered by type (e.g. interns do not see Slots / Earnings / Appointments)
